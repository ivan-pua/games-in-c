# Fun games to Play in C Language

I have developed two interesting games in C langauge:
## 1. You Chew

This program finds the maximum score of a game called You Chew, which is played by rolling a 9-sided dice five times. Valid rules and conditions are present in this game

## 2. CWords

This program is to see words that be created from the letters given in a way to maximise the score. It's inspired by the board game Scrabble.

### Happy playing! :)
