This repo consists of my work in COMP2521 - Data Structures and Algorithms, some of the notable ones include:
* Breadth-first and Depth-first search
* Reverse a double linked list
* Identifying a perfectly balanced tree

The input tests and header files are included in this repo.

Also, I have completed two assignments:
## 1. Text Buffer

To implement an abstract textbuffer data type that meets the given interface.

## 2. Social Network Analysis

To implement graph based data analysis functions (ADTs) to mine a given social network and perform Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)
